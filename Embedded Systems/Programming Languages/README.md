# Programming Languages

The most common programming languages for embedded systems are:
- ## 1️⃣ C (Most Widely Used)
  - Direct hardware control
  - Low memory usage
  - Fast execution
  - Used in: Microcontrollers (AVR, STM32, ESP32, etc.), RTOS

- ## 2️⃣ C++ (For Complex Systems)
  - Object-oriented for large projects
  - Still low-level enough for efficiency
  - Used in: Embedded Linux, Automotive systems

- ## 3️⃣ Assembly (For Ultra Low-Level Control)
  - Maximum optimization
  - Direct access to CPU registers
  - Used in: Bootloaders, firmware, low-power devices

- ## 4️⃣ Python (For Embedded Linux & AI on Edge Devices)
  - Easy to code & debug
  - Used with MicroPython & Raspberry Pi
  - Used in: IoT devices, Machine learning on embedded

- ## 5️⃣ Rust (For Safety-Critical Systems)
  - Memory safety (no buffer overflows)
  - High performance like C
  - Used in: Medical devices, Automotive, Aerospace
      
## [Coding sandards/conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_conventions)
> Are a set of guidelines for a specific programming language that recommend programming style, practices, and methods for each aspect of a program written in that language.
> 
> These conventions usually cover file organization, indentation, comments, declarations, statements, white space, naming conventions, programming practices, programming principles, programming rules of thumb, architectural best practices, etc.
> 
> These are guidelines for software structural quality. Software programmers are highly recommended to follow these guidelines to help improve the readability of their source code and make software maintenance easier. Coding conventions are only applicable to the human maintainers and peer reviewers of a software project. Conventions may be formalized in a documented set of rules that an entire team or company follows, or may be as informal as the habitual coding practices of an individual. Coding conventions are not enforced by **compilers**.
>
> Coding standards include the **SEI CERT Coding Standard, MISRA and High Integrity C++**.
