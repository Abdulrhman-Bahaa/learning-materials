# Programming Languages

The most common programming languages for embedded systems are:
- ## 1️⃣ C (Most Widely Used)
  - Direct hardware control
  - Low memory usage
  - Fast execution
  - Used in: Microcontrollers (AVR, STM32, ESP32, etc.), RTOS

- ## 2️⃣ C++ (For Complex Systems)
  - Object-oriented for large projects
  - Still low-level enough for efficiency
  - Used in: Embedded Linux, Automotive systems

- ## 3️⃣ Assembly (For Ultra Low-Level Control)
  - Maximum optimization
  - Direct access to CPU registers
  - Used in: Bootloaders, firmware, low-power devices

- ## 4️⃣ Python (For Embedded Linux & AI on Edge Devices)
  - Easy to code & debug
  - Used with MicroPython & Raspberry Pi
  - Used in: IoT devices, Machine learning on embedded

- ## 5️⃣ Rust (For Safety-Critical Systems)
  - Memory safety (no buffer overflows)
  - High performance like C
  - Used in: Medical devices, Automotive, Aerospace
