# Embedded C
## C coding standards
- **[SEI CERT C Coding Standards](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/SEI+CERT+C+Coding+Standard)**
> Are software coding standards developed by the CERT Coordination Center to improve the safety, reliability, and security of software systems

- **[MISRA C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MISRA_C)**
> Is a set of software development guidelines for the C programming language developed by The MISRA Consortium. Its aims are to facilitate code safety, security, portability and reliability in the context of embedded systems, specifically those systems programmed in ISO C / C90 / C99.

- **[The Power of 10: Rules for Developing Safety-Critical Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_10:_Rules_for_Developing_Safety-Critical_Code)**
> Were created in 2006 by Gerard J. Holzmann of the NASA/JPL Laboratory for Reliable Software.[1] The rules are intended to eliminate certain C coding practices that make code difficult to review or statically analyze. These rules are a complement to the MISRA C guidelines and have been incorporated into the greater set of JPL coding standards.
